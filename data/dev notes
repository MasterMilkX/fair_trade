Version 0.1
============
~ If needed to scale up - scale the sprites up x2
~ Keeping this size might be good for grainy GBC look and memory rendering
~ Buggy dialogue system - searching for solution
~ Determine how to handle journal system

TODO
+ Draw buildings/props --> tileset
+ Fix dialogue
+ Fix journal
+ FIx NPC boundaries (relative to the buildings and props?)


Version 0.2
============
~ Split text based on this pattern:
	| Line 1 
	| Line 2 \/
	| Line 3 
	+---------
	| Line 1

dialog = ["Line 1 | Line 2 | Line 3", "Line 1"]
~ These are hard-coded line breaks - not efficient but necessary for the RPG

TODO
+ Draw buildings/props --> tileset
+ Fix journal
+ Map out window boundaries


Version 0.4
===========
~ Concept art for each character?
~ Tile interaction (or invisible object)

TODO
+ Start to develop quests
+ Test options and choice system (look at story from Pizza Planet)
