SID TRUE QUEST
+++++++++++++++

$ Item : Token
---------------
	Sid :	
			Whoa!
			Hey, I didn't see you there!
			How's it going, dude? I'm Sid
			> [Kyle]
				Nice... That's a pretty great name
			> [Name's Kyle]
				Coolio dude!
				Nice to meet you
			> [I think I'm Kyle]
				You think?
				Well.. I'll call you Kyle until you feel like being called something else
			> [Sup? I'm Kyle]
				Man... you seem cool Kyle!
			Hey do you have any records?
			I've gotten really into vinyl lately
			> [Nope, sorry]
				Ah no worries my dude
				They're hard to come by anyways
			> [No, but I have this]
				Have what?
			> [I broke them]
				Aw bummer...
				Oh well!
			Yo! What's that?
			> [A token?]
				A token...
				That seems about right!
			> [I don't know]
				It looks super cool though!
			> [I found it]
				Whoa really? Just like that?
				Must be lucky!
			I'll trade you something really cool for it
			Really really cool
			> [Deal]
				Sweet! Thanks!
				(you give the token to Sid)
				Here you go my dude
				(you got a mixtape from Sid)
				That's one of my fire mixtapes
				I've been meaning to spread the word and tell people about it
				But it's still needs something...
				Talk to people about the mixtape and they'll probably give you stuff to trade for it
				If you can find me the thing that I need, I'll trade you something even cooler, Kyle
				It'll be a fair trade
				& Activate Sid Quest
			> [No deal]
				Aw c'mon
				Really dude?
				Are you ABSOLUTELY sure, Kyle?
				> [I changed my mind]
					*see [Deal] above
				> [I don't want it anymore]
					*see [Deal] above
				> [You can have it]
					*see [Deal] above

$ Item : Mixtape
-----------------
	Grace :	
			Oh! Is that one of those mixtapes I've heard about?
			> [Trade?]
				Oh yes please!
				(you give Grace the mixtape)
				Thanks! I'm so excited to listen to it!
				I found this really pretty gem - you can have it
				(you got a sapphire from Grace)
				It matches your hair and clothes!
			> [Yeah it's fire]
				Oh wow! I haven't listened to it yet
				I'll be sure to keep an extinguisher around
	
$ Item : Sapphire
------------------
	Amber : 
			Ohmigosh! That gem!
			> [Trade?]
				Wow really? Thanks!
				(you give the sapphire to Amber)
				This'll look great on my crown
				Here take these
				(you got slippers from Amber)
				Those things are super comfy
				They make you feel like you're walking on air
			> [Razzle Dazzle]
				?
				Uh... ok?

$ Item : Slippers
------------------
	Kimi : 	
			Hmm... slippers...
			> [Trade?]
				...
				Sure...
				They'll help me sneak around
				(you give the slippers to Kimi)
				I don't really use this thing anymore since I have my katana
				So you can have it
				(you got a staff from Kimi)
				Good for whacking people
			> [Click your heels]
				...why would I do that?
				This isn't some kind of fairy tale

$ Item : Staff
---------------
	Chi : 
			Oh my! That's quite the staff
			> [Trade?]
				It'd be my pleasure
				Staffs are the perfect instrument of balance
				(you give the staff to Chi)
				I've just freshly brewed some of this tea
				I'll give you a cup
				(you got tea from Chi)
				It's chai... I think
			> [I know kung fu]
				Is that so?
				Can you demonstrate for me?
				> [I'd rather not]
					Understandable
					Power like that should be reserved as protection
				> [Of course]
					(you try to twirl the staff but you end up hitting yourself in the face)
					...
					*snicker*


$ Item : Tea
-------------
	Kay : 
			*sigh* This armor can get heavy
			> [Trade?]
				You want to trade my armor?
				Wait is that tea?
				...
				I can't give you the armor... But I'm so thirsty...
				Tell you what I'll give you something else that I've had for a while
				(you give the tea to Kay)
				(you got an EP Record from Kay)
				I don't remember who I got that record from...
				And the band sounds really obscure
				But you thanks for the tea!
			> [Can I wear it?]
				?!
				This armor is for knights only!

$ Item : EP Record
-------------------
	Sid : 
			Whoa! A record! And my favorite band too!
			> [Trade?]
				Bro! It's just what I wanted!
				And in mint condition too!
				Kyle, my dude, you've been a real pal to me.
				I want you to have this
				(you got a special key from Sid)
				Fair trade buddy
				I'll see you later!
				& Activate Sid End Game
			> [It's my favorite band too]
				Really?
				What's your favorite song?
				> [Uh]
					Oh man that's a classic!
					The guitar solo is just wicked
				> [I Can't Remember]
					Oh that's pretty popular
					That's what got me into the band
				> [Generic Songname]
					Dude! That's the best one!
					You have great taste, Kyle

End Game
---------
: (you find yourself in a dark room filled with flashing blue neon lights, fog, and the static from a TV)
: (you're sitting on a bean bag chair with a box of pizza, empty cans of root beer, and a video game controller in front of you)
: (party music plays loudly but muffled in another area - the bass vibrating through your core)
: (you feel a sense of peace... but incomplete)
: (try again?)



HINTS/SIDE CONVO
+++++++++++++++++

MIXTAPE
--------
	Sid : 	
			Yo!
			> [Trade?]
				lol
				I've listened to that tape a billion times dude
				Figured out the perfect sequence of songs too!
			> [How can I listen to it?]
				Oh! Right! So!
				... Um...
				Hmm...
				...
				No clue...
	Kimi : 	
			...Is that a tape?
			> [Yeah it's mixed]
				...
				With what and what?
	Chi :	
			Ah, a mixed tape!
			> [Can music touch you?]
				Music can indeed touch you
				Make sure you give consent first
	Kay :	
			Cool mixtape.
			> [Sid said it's fire]
				FIRE?!
				Put it out!!
				You could burn down the castle you maniac!
	Amber : 
			Whoa, who's hot jams?
			> [Sid made it]
				No way!
				He's got good taste
				Grace is a big fan of his tapes.

SAPPHIRE
---------
	Grace : 
			Hi!
			> [Trade?]
				Oh I don't need it back
				I've stared at it so much I'm surprised I'm not seeing blue!
			> [The blue is really pretty]
				Yeah!
				It matches your hair and clothes!
	Kimi : 	
			Where'd you get that sapphire?
			> [Grace gave it to me]
				Hmm... 
				Nice shade of blue...
				Amber will probably go crazy for that gem
	Chi :	
			A sapphire - I've never seen anything so blue
			> [What about the sky?]
				...
				The sky?
				I thought the sky was multicolored pixels
	Kay :	
			Agh! That gem is so shiny it's blinding!
			> [(point it at Kay)]
				AGH! My eyes!!
	Sid : 	
			Dude! That's the coolest rock I've ever seen!
			> [How many rocks have you seen?]
				At least... 
				...
				15!

SLIPPERS
---------
	Amber : 
			Hey~
			> [Trade?]
				Boy! I gave you those slippers, remember?
				*sigh* You're funny
			> [Do you have these in a size 10?]
				Um...
				I don't think so
	Grace : 
			Aw! Cute slippers!
			> [Cute?]
				Definitely!
				If they were bunnies they'd be even cuter!
	Chi :	
			Those slippers look comfortable
			> [Ultimate comfort]
				That's a key to happiness!
				Live as comfortably as possible.
	Kay :	
			Are those magic slippers?
			> [Magic?]
				Slippers can make you move quietly
				Like a ninja or something
				Kimi would know
	Sid : 	
			Slippers?
			> [Fancy socks]
				Bro!
				You make a good point!

STAFF
------
	Kimi : 	
			Yeah?
			> [Trade?]
				...
				I gave you that staff
				I'll stick with my katana
			> [Wanna go?]
				...
				You know the reason I gave you that staff was because I upgraded to a katana
				Which means my weapon is better than the one you currently have
				Are you serious?
				> [Yeah let's fight!]
					Omae wa mou shindeiru
					(nani?)
					(you get hit in the face with the butt of Kimi's katana)
					I'll kill you - I'm not even worried about it
				> [I changed my mind]
					Smart
	Grace : 
			*gasp* That staff!
			> [What about it?]
				It looks so cool!
				It makes you look like a kung fu master!
				Just like Chi!
	Amber :	
			That's a really long stick!
			> [It's a staff]
				Huh...
				Must have came from a really tall tree
	Kay :	
			Hey! Watch where you swing that thing!
			> [Huh?]
				(you turn around swinging the staff)
				AGH!
				(Kay ducks down)
				Careful!!
	Sid : 	
			Can that thing make you fly, Kyle?
			> [Fly?]
				Yeah dude!
				I saw a staff that could make a guy fly one time!

TEA
----
	Chi :	
			Hello!
			> [Trade?]
				Oh I've got plenty of tea
				You should share the tea I gave you with someone who needs it
			> [Please sir, may I have some more?]
				You must empty your cup before you can fill it again
	Grace : 
			Ooo, tea!
			> [Want some?]
				I'd love to
				But unfortunately tea just goes straight through me
				Figuratively and literally!
	Amber :	
			Is that tea?
			> [Yep]
				Hmm...
				I'm more of a iced sugar-free vanilla latte with soy milk and caramel drizzle kind of girl
	Kimi :	
			Hmm... smells like chai
			> [It is]
				Ah...
				Personally, I think jasmine is better
	Sid : 	
			Hey, tea!
			> [Thirsty?]
				Oh nah bro. I've got enough energy drinks to keep me awake for an eternity
				Kay is probably thirsty from patrolling that castle though
				And wearing that heavy armor

EP Record
----------
	Kay :	
			Oh... hi!
			> [Trade?]
				Um...
				Actually... I gave that record to you
				I don't have time to play it
				I've got a castle to protect!
			> [How do I play this?]
				I think some kind of spinny thing
				I've seen them before somewhere
				Can't remember...
	Grace : 
			What a cool disk!
			> [Wanna play frisbee?]
				Oh my coordination is awful
				I'm not very good at catching anything
				I can't even catch a cold!
	Kimi : 	
			Who's record is that?
			> [Kay's]
				...
				Kay listens to music?
				I didn't think he could hear anything through that metal helmet
	Chi : 	
			Ah, an old-fashioned vinyl record
			> [Old?]
				Sid used to have some a very long time ago
				His music choice was...
				...unique
	Amber : 
			Hey, that's pretty retro!
			> [Groovy man]
				Right on!
