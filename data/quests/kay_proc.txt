				"Eventually you | will obtain what | I need",
			> "Did you | win | this?"
				"Indeed!",
				"In a sparring | competition!",
				"It's not first | prize since I got | knocked out in | the first round",
				"But it's a | medallion for | having the best | spirit!",
				"So it still | counts!",

				"...Uh..",
				"Special chakra | enhancing elixir!",
				"Heh heh...",
	Sid :
			"Hey, what's that | clear stuff in | there?",
			> "Air?"
				"Or... it could be | an invisibility | potion!",
				"That'd be so | cool!",
				"Kimi would be | impossible to | find with that | stuff",
	Grace :
			"*gasp* A bottle!",
			> "Why are | you | excited?"
				"You can put so | much stuff into | bottles!",
				"Fairies, potions, | secret messages, | tiny ships...",
				"The possibilities | are endless",
	Kay :
			"What is that? A | poisonous gas?!",
			> "In the | bottle?"

	Kay :
			"Is that a letter?",
			> "You've | got | mail...?"
				"Sorry, Kyle",
				"Amber's the only | one who writes to | me",

				"I can understand | - blue would | probably be your | favorite color | instead",
			> "Where's | the | wire?"
				"I can't remember | if I bought them | because they were | wireless...",
				"Or if I just lost | the wire to | them...",
	Kimi :
			"...Headphones?",
			> "Wanna | listen?"
				"...",
				"...It's not | connected to | anything",
				"Though I do enjoy | the sound of | silence",
	Chi :
			"Ah, nice | headphones",
			> "Do you | listen | to music"
				"Just the sound of | nature",
				"It's a great | album! I highly | recommend it",

	Kay :
			"Whose headphones | are those?",
			> "Grace's"
				"I thought they | looked familiar!",
				"I prefer earbuds | anyways",
				"Headphones got in | the way of my | helmet and just | looked weird",

				"It promotes the | freedom of | information!",
				"Even by... | somewhat illegal | means",
	Kay :
			"That movie!",
			> "What | about | it?"
				"The title!",

HANDKERCHIEF
-------------
	Amber :

				"Negative, | positive, neutral",
				"It's quite a | mixture!",
