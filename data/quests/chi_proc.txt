End Game
---------
(you find yourself on a mountain cliff with a running waterfall on either side of you)
(you're sitting on a bed of flowers surrounded by warm candles and a plate of wafer cookies)
(the sunset in the distance makes the sky a deep red-orange mixture and you hear bells chime in the distance)
(you feel a sense of peace - but incomplete)
(try again?)

	Chi :
			"What a sharp | arrow head",
			> "Pointy | too"
				"I wouldn't | recommend | shooting it in | the air then",

			> "How do I | play it?"
				"You shouldn't | ever!",
				"It's only to be | used in dire | emergencies!",
				"Like an invasion | or flying snake | attack",
	Kimi :
			"What the...",
			> "brrpphh!"
				"(Kimi doesn't | flinch but looks | very annoyed)",

				"I'm more of a | calzone and pizza | roll kinda gal",
				"I also can't eat | - I'm a little | dead",
				"Hehe",
	Chi :
			"*achoo*",
			> "Are you | ok?"
				"Yes I'm fine",
				"I'm just allergic | to cheese",
				"I'm lactose | intolerant you | see",
				> "But why | did you | sneeze?"
					"It's the smell of | the cheese",
				> "What | about | milk?"
					"Oh milk is | absolutely fine",
					"It's one of my | favorite drinks | actually",
				> "So you | can't | cut | cheese?"
