KYLE TRUE QUEST

KIMI
-----
			...
			..Uh, hi?
			> [Hi.]
				...
				...Right...
			> [Hi?]
				Hmm...
				You seem unsure of that
			> [Hi!]
				!
				God you're chipper...
				It's almost annoying actually
			I don't think I've seen you around
			Who are you?
			> [Kyle]
				Huh...
				Ok then...Kyle...
			> [Kyle I guess]
				Kyle I Guess?
				That's quite a name
				I'll call you Kyle for short
			> [Kyle?]
				You don't know?
				... well...
				I guess people don't really have a choice on what they get to be called
			> [I'm Kyle!]
				Wow...
				You seem pretty proud of that
				Kyle's an OK name I suppose...
			I'm Kimi

			What are you doing here?
			> [I need to talk to you]
				Hm...
				I don't talk Kyle...
			> [I need some -thing]
				Uh huh...
				We all do Kyle
			> [I don't know]
				Oh...
				You don't remember? 
				What a shame...
				I can help
			Let's do something different
			If you really know me - if you've been here before 
			Then answer these questions
			If you get enough right, I'll give you what you need
			Deal?
			> [No deal]
				Suit yourself
				Take this then
				(you got a corrupt key from Kimi)
				It's a way out but you won't like it
				Come back when you know more about this world
			> [Deal]
				Ok...
				What instrument do I play?
				> [Violin]
				> [Bass]
				> [Flute]
					...
					I did...
					Well, you got the first question right
				What weapon do I use?
				> [Staff]
				> [Arrow]
				> [Katana]
					...
					I do..
					That seemed obvious
					I'm a ninja/samurai after all..
				Who do I give letters to?
				> [Sid]
				> [Chi]
				> [Amber]
				> [Kay]
				> [Grace]
					...
					That's true..
					She doesn't remember me though - or what I did
					That's probably for the best...
				Congrats, you passed Kyle
				> [Are you ok?]
					...
					Fine I guess
					Lonely and miserable as usual
					> [Why?]
					> [Don't be upset]
					> [What about Grace?]
					...
				> [Now what?]
					I don't know
					I guess you're stuck here like the rest of us
					> [So you lied?]
						...
						Yeah...
						Sometimes you have to lie to protect people
					> [Are you gonna help me?]
						...I don't know
						I don't know if I can
						I'm bad at helping people anyways
				> [That's it?]
					...Yeah
					Sorry to ruin your expectations
				You're looking for peace right?
				No matter how hard you try you feel incomplete?
				> [Yeah]
					...Figures
				> [How'd you know]
					Because we all are doing the same thing
				> [What?]
					...Never mind...
				It doesn't exist
				You did something in your past life and now you're stuck here
				Looking for a non-existent peace
				> [What about you]
				> [What did you do?]
				> [How did you get stuck?]
					Me?
					...
					I tried to help someone I loved
					But ended up just making it worse...
					She wasn't happy with her life
					And everything I did couldn't make her feel better
					So she asked me for one final solution - and I obliged
					I gave her nightshade
					Now she's gone...
					But she haunts me, and she doesn't remember me - or what we used to be
					She's happy though... but for the wrong reasons...
					I couldn't help her... And I don't understand...
					I'm just lonely and guilty now... It's not fair...
				> [It's gonna be OK]
				> [You're not alone]
				> [You care a lot]
				...
				Thanks Kyle
				I guess... If you care about someone...
				You have to help them through whatever they're going through
				You have to keep them safe and protect them but also take care of yourself
				Death shouldn't ever be a solution
				Everything will end up being OK in the end
				I wish I realized that before...
				...
				Thank you Kyle
				I feel at peace now - I guess I was wrong
				It does exist
				Here take this
				(you got a katana from Kimi)
				I'm going to use my key
				Thanks again for your help
				I'll see you around
				(Kimi disappears)





SID
----
			Whoa!
			Hey, I didn't see you there!
			How's it going, dude? I'm Sid
			> [Kyle]
				Nice... That's a pretty great name
			> [Name's Kyle]
				Coolio dude!
				Nice to meet you
			> [I think I'm Kyle]
				You think?
				Well.. I'll call you Kyle until you feel like being called something else
			> [Sup? I'm Kyle]
				Man... you seem cool Kyle!
			Hey do you have any records?
			I've gotten really into vinyl lately
			> [Nope, sorry]
				Ah no worries my dude
				They're hard to come by anyways
			> [No, but I have this]
				Have what?
			> [I broke them]
				Aw bummer...
				Oh well!

			So what's up, my dude?
			> [I need to talk to you]
				Oh yeah?
				A TALK talk, huh?
				Oh man...
			> [I need some -thing]
				Yeah?
				I think I can help!
			> [I don't know]
				Haha! I feel you bro
				Maybe I can help you remember
			So here's what's gonna happen
			You've been here before, amiright?
			So then we've been bros before - and you know me like a true bro
			I'll quiz you
			If you get all the question right, you win!
			Cool beans?
			> [No deal]
				Aw, ok
				Here you go then
				(you got a corrupt key from Sid)
				It's kinda crappy to be honest
				But it'll take you where you need to go
				I hope we're bros in another life!
			> [Deal]
				Sweeeet! Ok Question 1:
				What do I make my music on?
				> [Mixtape]
					Correct!
					Gotta go old school
					Heh heh
				Question 2:
				What's my favorite soda?
				> [Cola]
				> [Ginger beer]
				> [Orange soda]
				> [Root beer]
					Right again!
					Best party drink ever!
				Ok last question...
				Who did I give my last record to?
				> [Kimi]
				> [Grace]
				> [Chi]
				> [Amber]
				> [Kay]
					Yeah!
					He borrowed it for a bit
					I didn't even know he liked music
				Well congrats dude! You win!
				> [Prize?]
					Oh a prize right!
					Uh...
				> [What do I win?]
					Win?
					Oh right! Hmm...
				> [Now what?]
					Heh heh...
					Uhhh...
				You get to stay here and party with me forever!
				Yaaay... Heh...
				> [Forever?]
					Yeah...
					It's... not as great as it sounds in reality...
				> [I don't want to party]
					Ah...
					I understand...
					To be honest, I've gotten a little sick of partying too
				> [That's not what I need]
					Oh...
					Yeah I guess partying isn't a priority given the situation
				I'm stuck here... Just like everyone else
				You're trying to find that sense of peace or something, right?
				> [Yeah]
					Ha! Same!
				> [How'd you know]
					Oh! Because I am too!
				> [What?]
					?
					Oh, um..
					Anyways!
				I can't remember how long I've been here - I've never found it
				> [Why are you stuck?]
				> [Why don't you party?]
				> [You can't remem -ber?]
				I... uhh... went a little overboard one night
				Made some really bad decisions and did some bad things
				I had no idea - I ignored my limits because I thought it was cool
				I was having such a fun time - I was the life of the party!
				So when I drove home, there was this sign that was broken
				And the road just took a sharp turn and then...
				I ended up here!
				I mean everyone is nice and it's cool and everything but...
				I still screwed up... BIG TIME
				Whoops... heh...
				> [It's gonna be ok]
				> [Be more careful]
				> [Stay safe]
				Yeah...
				Yeah! You're right Kyle!
				I need to own up to my mistakes!
				Set limits! Protect myself! Watch out for bad signs - literally and figuratively
				Thanks a billion dude
				I found my peace! I finally found it!
				Here! Take this - I insist
				(you got a beanie from Sid)
				I'm gonna go and use my key
				I hope you find yours too dude
				Maybe we can chill or hang later
				I'll be looking for you
				(Sid disappears)





GRACE
-----
			*gasp*
			You scared the life out of me!
			Haha! Just kidding! 
			I'm already a ghost
			> [You're dead?]
				Yep!
				It's ok though
				It's really relaxing just floating around
			> [You're taking this lightly]
				Haha! That was a great pun!
			> [Are you a ghost or a spirit]
				I'm a ghost but full of spirit!
			I'm Grace by the way
			What's your name?
			> [Kyle]
				Kyle?
				That's a nice name!
			> [I'm Kyle]
				Hi Kyle!
				Nice to meet you!
			> [Probably Kyle]
				Probably?
				I don't meet a lot of people named "Probably"
				But I'll definitely remember "Kyle" so I'll call you that
			> [Uh... Kyle]
				Okee dokee Kyle!

			So did you need anything?
			> [I need to talk to you]
				Really?
				I love talking to people!
			> [I need some -thing]
				You do?
				OK! I could probably help you get it!
			> [I don't know]
				Aaaw...
				We'll figure it out together, OK?
			*gasp* Let's play a game!
			\"How well do you know me?\"
			I'll make it super duper easy too
			When you get them all right something special happens!
			Sound fun?
			> [No deal]
				Aaawww ok Kyle
				Well you can have this anyways
				(you got a corrupt key from Grace)
				Personally I don't like using that key
				But it's a key! And keys always lead somewhere
				Maybe something on the otherside can help you figure out what you need
				Nice seeing you Kyle!
			> [Deal]
				Yay! This is gonna be so fun!
				Alrighty...
				What's my favorite thing in the whole world?
				> [The world]
				> [Your grave]
				> [Flowers]
					Uh huh!
					That's why I put them all around my grave
					It makes it super pretty!
				What's my favorite cake flavor?
				> [Choco -late]
				> [Yellow]
				> [Vanilla]
					That's right!
					It's soooooo good - I could eat a whole cake by myself!
				Who makes really awesome mixtapes for me?
				> [Kimi]
				> [Chi]
				> [Amber]
				> [Kay]
				> [Sid]
					Yeah! 
					He makes them straight out of his car too!
					I really love the violin in some of the songs
			Kyle! You did so well!
			Congratulations!
			> [Do I win a prize?]
				Oh, um
				Maybe?
			> [What happens?]
				Hm...
				I don't know actually
			> [Now what?]
				That's a good question...
				No clue!
			I feel like I've always been here
			I can't really remember anything - what happened before or what happens after
			But that's OK! I kinda like it here!
			> [You don't remem -ber?]
			> [You like it?]
			> [It's ok?]
			Yeah!
			I mean I get letters from Kimi sometimes
			She tells me stories about this one girl - she seems really sad
			And this other girl who tries to help her not be sad
			I don't understand it but I really want to
			But other times Kimi writes me really pretty haikus
			It's like I've read them before but I know I haven't - almost like a nostalgia
			So yeah! I've got my letters, my flowers, my music, my grave
			It's fun!
			But I still feel like I'm missing something...
			> [It's gonna be OK]
			> [Reflect on yourself]
			> [Look for more in life]
			*gasp* You're right Kyle!
			I'm happy for what I have, but I still need to have a goal 
			I should talk to Kimi about the letters - I never had a chance to
			And even though I look on the bright side of life, I have to remember that everything isn't viewed through rose colored lenses
			There's pain and incompleteness - but it'll be OK
			Hey...
			I felt something... Just now...
			It's like... peace?
			That's weird - even though I'm dead, I've never felt this feeling before
			I like it!
			Thanks Kyle! You rock
			This is special to me but I want you to have it
			(you got a soul from Grace)
			I think I'm gonna head out and look for more in the second life I was given
			I'll see you on the other side Kyle!
			(Grace disappears)






CHI
----
			Oh, hello
			How are you today?
			> [Great!]
				That's fantastic!
				I hope your day continues to stay positive!
			> [I'm not sure]
				Well that's alright
				The day still has potential to become interesting!
			> [Meh]
				Oh I'm sorry to hear that
				Well there's always tomorrow!
			Nice to meet you
			I'm Chi
			And you are?
			> [Kyle]
				Kyle?
				The name suits you!
			> [Kyle I suppose]
				You suppose?
				Well if that's what feels right to you, then Kyle it shall be
			> [You can call me Kyle]
				Excellent!
				Kyle it is!
			> [I am Kyle]
				Ah, Kyle!
				What a great name!

			Now... What can I do for you today?
			> [I need to talk to you]
				A talk?
				So be it! Let's talk
			> [I need some -thing]
				Ah of course!
				I can be of assistance
			> [I don't know]
				Well that's quite alright
				Perhaps I can enlighten you
			But first... A test of wits!
			I'll challenge you to a few short questions
			If you answer correctly then I shall aid you in your journey for information
			So what is your decision?
			> [No deal]
				Very well - I can respect that
				Take this item instead
				(you got a corrupt key from Chi)
				It may not be your preference for answers
				But it is answers regardless
			> [Deal]
				Excellent!
				We'll begin...
				What lucky item do I hold on me?
				> [Clover]
				> [Horshoe]
				> [Dice]
					Correct!
					It's not as heavy or perishable
				What do I collect?
				> [Stamps]
				> [Bugs]
				> [Bottle -caps]
					Yes!
					I predict that someday it will become a very valuable currency
				Who uses the oils I make from flowers?
				> [Kimi]
				> [Sid]
				> [Grace]
				> [Kay]
				> [Amber]
					Right!
					She is quite the fan of the essence of nature
				Well done Kyle
				You've completed the questionaire
				> [What do I get?]
					You are now smarter than you were before we started this conversation
				> [Now what?]
					Whatever you wish!
				> [Cool]
					Yes it is very cool indeed!
				Now if you'll excuse me I'll go back to my meditating
				> [I still need some -thing]
				> [Please help]
				> [What?]
				?
				Oh... I'm sorry Kyle but...
				What you seek is practically impossible
				It's peace right?
				> [Yes]
				> [I think so]
				> [Maybe]
				*sigh* Peace is hard to come by
				So I've just dedicated the rest of my life and focus to meditating and studying my state of mind
				It's not peace but it's a nice alternative
				> [Why?]
				> [No way]
				> [There's gotta be more]
				Kyle...
				A long time ago, I used to be absorbed in frivolous matters
				I would dedicate myself to being the very best and being a perfectionist 
				I wanted every material possession, have the most money, be the top in my career and lifestyle
				It ultimately got me nowhere - and I dissolved relationships with others
				Now I'm here... And I have all the energy in the world to focus on one thing - like I've always wanted
				So again... please excuse me while I meditate
				> [It's gonna be OK]
				> [Take a break]
				> [Find a balance]
				Hmm...
				I never thought about that
				And I've done nothing but think about how to find peace
				But I've missed the entire point - I focus too hard
				I need to relax, and focus on different things
				There is a solution and a finishing point but no rush to reach it
				It's good to have a goal - but shutting out the rest of the world to achieve it doesn't help anyone
				Thank you Kyle!
				I feel truly enlightened... and at true peace!
				Here, keep this as a token of my gratitude
				(you got a cloud from Chi)
				My meditation is done and my goal complete
				I think I'll go take a break and use my key
				May we cross paths again, Kyle
				(Chi disappears)







KAY
----
			HALT! Who goes there?
			> [Uh...]
				Not another word!
				You're new here so I'll go easy on you
			> [No one]
				Ha! Do you take me for a fool?
				My helmet limits my visibility but there is DEFINITELY someone right in front of me
			> [Me! Fight me!]
				What?!
				I haven't had a challenge in years!
				I'm a little rusty...
				In skill not just armor
			What is your name, stranger?
			> [Kyle]
				Kyle? a very threatening name
			> [Um... Kyle?]
				Ha! You don't even know your own name?
				You poor soul
			> [The Mighty Kyle]
				Mighty?!
				Pssh... uh I mean...
				Yeah... mighty where YOU come from I guess
			> [I go by Kyle]
				Ah... I see
				Kyyylleee...
			Alright then, "Kyle"...
			You can call me Kay - Sir Kay!
			I protect this castle and the beautiful lady who inhabits it!

			So what is your business here?
			> [I need to talk to you]
				Talk?!
			> [I need some -thing]
				Agh!
				A request?
				All right then...
			> [I don't know]
				Hmm...
				That's a problem
			Well then Kyle
			Before we continue with this issue you have - I'll test to see if you are worthy
			Is this fair?
			> [No deal]
				I see...
				Well in that case!
				I can give you this instead
				(you got a corrupt key from Kay)
				In all honesty, it's not the best thing in the world
				But! A key is a key! And you'll have to make do until you feel worthy enough
			> [Deal]
				All right!
				What did I win my medal for?
				> [1st place]
				> [Best Armor]
				> [Good Spirit]
					Correct!
					Good spirit will always see you through a battle if not your weapon
				What color is my ideal sword?
				> [Silver]
				> [Gold]
				> [Black]
					Yes!
					Honestly not for the strength of the metal - I just think it looks more intimidating
				Who makes the best tea?
				> [Kimi]
				> [Sid]
				> [Grace]
				> [Amber]
				> [Chi]
					Ha! Right!
					It's absolutely heavenly actually
				Good show Kyle! You passed!
				> [What do I win?]
					Kyle!
					It's not about winning - it's about having fun
				> [Now what?]
					Um... Well...
					Whatever you want I suppose!
				> [Am I a knight now?]
					Knighthood?
					For completing a test?
					HAHAHAHAHA!
					I wish it was that easy...
				Now you can go forth with your new title of \"Test Completer\"
				> [I still need some -thing]
				> [Help me]
				> [You're my only hope]
				?!
				Oh boy... 
				Uh... Listen Kyle... 
				This isn't going to be easy to take in...
				That thing you need? It's peace... Is that right?
				> [Yes!]
				> [Of course]
				> [Yessir]
				Yes... well...
				No one has ever been able to find it
				I've searched for it - EVERYWHERE
				Not for myself but mostly for Amber
				It's my fault she's here anyways
				> [What do you mean?]
				> [Your fault?]
				> [Why for Amber?]
				Well... 
				Back in the days of knights and princesses
				A knight was supposed to protect his princess
				And I wasn't the... best of the knights
				I fell asleep on the job and lacked motivation to train and go on quests
				I said no whenever anyone asked me to do anything
				And one day - when I was supposed to be on patrol and guarding the castle
				Invaders came and... burned the castle down...
				It's all my fault!
				So now I protect the castle with my life and patrol the entrance non-stop everyday!
				I know it can never make up for what happened
				I'm still the worst knight ever
				> [It's gonna be OK]
				> [You're a good knight]
				> [You can do it]
				?
				Really?
				You think so?
				...
				OK!
				I slacked off in the past and it cost me my life and others lives
				But my history doesn't define me - I'll rise up to any challenge now
				My motivation and drive is stronger than ever - and I'll protect people
				I'm a good knight for what I choose to do now - not what I've done in the past
				Thank you Kyle! Thank you so much!
				I found my peace and completed my lifelong quest
				I can't grant you knighthood - but I'll give you the second best
				(you got a shield from Kay)
				My key calls to me so I shall part ways with you
				Please take care of Amber for me
				I'd be honored to meet you again
				(Kay disappears)







AMBER
------
			Oh
			My 
			Gosh!
			Who did your hair? I love it!
			> [I don't know]
				Ooohh ok...
				I see how it is...
				You wanna keep your mysterious hairdresser all to yourself?
				I can respect that 
				I'd probably do the same thing if I had someone who could work magic on my hair
			> [It's natural]
				No way!
				I've never seen anyone just born with that hair color
				Except in cartoons or something
			> [I did]
				Whoa! You did?
				You must be a really good stylist!
				You gotta do mine sometime! Please? Pretty Please?
			Oh! I'm Amber - THE Amber
			> [Kyle]
				Hey Kyle
				What's shakin'?
			> [Name's Kyle]
				Wow, your name's as cool as your hair
			> [It's Kyle?]
				Kyle?
				Do you not know?
				Oh whatever - I like the name Kyle so I'll still call you that
			> [The Kyle]
				Oooh! I've never heard of you
				You must be a rising star! Rad...
			So Kyle...
			What brings you to these parts?
			> [I need to talk to you]
				Yaaas!
				I haven't had anyone else to talk to besides Kay in forever!
			> [I need some -thing]
				Oh really?
				I might have something around her for you
			> [I don't know]
				Wooooow
				Was it one of those moments where you walked into a room and you forget what you went in for?
				I get those all the time
			Ok - first things first
			We gotta lay down the law and I gotta see if you're legit
			I'm gonna quiz you on stuff about me
			If you get them all right then we're green - super green
			You feel me?
			> [No deal]
				OK OK
				I'm not gonna force you into anything don't worry
				But here this might help you anyways
				(you got a corrput key from Amber)
				It may or may not help you - I dunno
				But I hope you find what you needed!
			> [Deal]
				Raaaad!
				Let's do this
				What's my favorite flower?
				> [Daisy]
				> [Violet]
				> [Rose]
					Of course!
					They're the absolute best flowers
					Every romantic movie uses them!
				What do I use to call Kay?
				> [Whistle]
				> [Phone]
				> [Horn]
					Yepperoni!
					He made it himself too - it's cute
				Who's got the best fashion sense - other than me and you
				> [Chi]
				> [Sid]
				> [Grace]
				> [Kay]
				> [Kimi]
					Uh yeah!
					Our styles are surprisingly similar
					She gives me her old hats and I give her ribbons and slippers sometimes
				Kyle! You did awesome!
				I'm so proud - you know me so well!
				> [Can you help me?]
					Right! 
					About that...
				> [Is there more?]
					More what?
					Oh! Um...
				> [Now what?]
					Now?
				Actually Kyle - and don't be mad
				I know what you need
				It's that complete peace stuff right?
				> [Yep]
				> [Uh huh]
				> [Correcto]
				I knew it! 
				Yeah so we're all out of that
				And by \"all out\" I mean we never had it to begin with - no one did
				Everyone is supposed to find it on their own
				It's so hard - it's like a puzzle to solve
				Something to do with fixing our old selves or something
				> [Puzzle?]
				> [Old self?]
				> [Fix?]
				Yep
				My old self was soooooo pathetic - not gonna lie
				Old Amber isn't as cool as new Amber
				I used to be so self-conscious
				I thought people were always watching me and judging me
				Well... everyone watches princesses
				But I was always the center of gossip and people would say things about me behind my back
				I'd hear rumors about people talking about how I looked, or what I said, or how I acted
				I felt like I couldn't trust anyone - or myself
				Why would people do such things?
				> [It's gonna be OK]
				> [Don't worry about them]
				> [Haters gonna hate]
				...
				YEAH!
				HECK YEAH!
				You're so right Kyle!
				Why should I let other people make me feel so bad about myself?
				I barely know them! And they barely know me
				My self-esteem almost shattered because people were just hating
				The people that really care about me will see me for my true self - past my insecurities
				And those other jerks can just suck it - cuz' they don't matter anyways!
				Ahhh... I feel so relieved!
				Is this... that peace?
				I love it!
				Thanks Kyle! I totally owe you one!
				Actually - I have an idea
				Take this - it doesn't hold any power over me now
				(you got a crown from Amber)	
				Wow! I think I'll use that key I got a long time ago
				Everything's so fantastic now
				Kyle - I'll catch you later
				Maybe if you wanna go shopping or something
				Byyyyeee~ 
				(Amber disappears)

			Goodbye Kyle
			And thank you



	END GAME :
