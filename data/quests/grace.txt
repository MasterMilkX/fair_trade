			*gasp*
			You scared the life out of me!
			Haha! Just kidding! 
			I'm already a ghost
			> [You're dead?]
				Yep!
				It's ok though
				It's really relaxing just floating around
			> [You're taking this lightly]
				Haha! That was a great pun!
			> [Are you a ghost or a spirit]
				I'm a ghost but full of spirit!
			I'm Grace by the way
			What's your name?
			> [Kyle]
				Kyle?
				That's a nice name!
			> [I'm Kyle]
				Hi Kyle!
				Nice to meet you!
			> [Probably Kyle]
				Probably?
				I don't meet a lot of people named "Probably"
				But I'll definitely remember "Kyle" so I'll call you that
			> [Uh... Kyle]
				Okee dokee Kyle!
			Hey, what's that thingy?
			> [A thingy?]
				Yeah a thingy!
				A special thingy!
			> [A token?]
				Yeah! One of those things!
				I can't believe you have one!
			> [Nothing]
				Pssh... I can see it clear as my body, Kyle
				You've got a thingy!
			Do you wanna trade?
			I can give you something really nice for it~
			> [Deal]
				Yay! I'm so happy!
				(you give the token to Grace)
				Thanks Kyle!
				Here... just as promised
				(you got a fairy from Grace)
				That's a magic fairy I caught that can heal
				I don't think it'll work on you since you look pretty healthy
				And it doesn't work on me because I'm already dead
				But if you give it to someone else who it CAN work on, they'll give you something in return
				If you find me another thingy I'll give you another thingy
				I'll keep it a fair trade
				Pinky promise!

			> [Trade?]
				...Really?
				I've always wanted one of my own!
				(you give Kay the fairy)
				Now I'll be practically invincible!
				Here! You can have this old helmet
				(you got an old helmet from Kay)
				I don't really use it anymore - I just got a new helmet with much better stats
			> [A magical fairy]
				A fairy?!
				I've heard stories of heroes having fairy companions with them for adventures
				They protected them from harm and healed their wounds
				Those heroes were legendary!

$ Item : Fairy
--------------
	Kimi :
			...Is that Kay's helmet?
			> [Trade?]
				Sure...

				Training just got a lot more fun
				I won't be needing this anymore so you can have it
				(you got a hat from Kimi)
				It's antique... mostly...
			> [It's mine now]
				Hmm...
				I doubt you could see anything with that thing
				And it makes you look just as dorky

	Amber : 
			Whoa! Stylish hat!
			> [Trade?]
				Yas!

				Ugh! It's so vintage! I love it!

				(you got a pillow from Amber)
				It's suuuuper comfy
				With the perfect support

				I can hang this on my rearview mirror of my car!
				I won't be needing this little guy anymore so here you go
				(you got a plush puppy from Sid)
				He's cute but he just took up way to much space on my dashboard
				And his eyes get creepy after a while...
			> [Place your bets!]
				Aw jeez man!
				I don't have any money!
				And just the worst luck in general when it comes to gambling

End Game
---------
: (you find yourself in a green meadow with blue skies and warm rays of sunshine beaming down on you)
: (you're sitting on a red and white checkered picnic blanket - 2 plates of vanilla cake on either side of you)
: (the wind blows gently over the hills - a soft flute melody playing far away)
: (you feel a sense of peace - but incomplete)
: (try again?)



HINTS/SIDE CONVO
+++++++++++++++++

FAIRY
------
	Grace :
			Hi Kyle!
			> [Trade?]
				Hehe! I just gave that to you Kyle!
				You better hurry and find someone who can use that fairy
				They can get very antsy
			> [Is the fairy ok?]
				Yeah definitely!
				I asked her first if it was ok
				Fairy's love to have companions
	Kimi : 
			What is that?
			> [A fairy]
				...
				Does it grant wishes or something?
				> [No it heals]
					...
					Well it's basically a glow-in-the-dark band-aid then
				> [That's a genie]
					Oh...
					Let me know when you find one then
					I've got a few wishes to make
	Sid :
			Whoa! A fairy!
			> [Does that make you Peter Pan?]
				Because of my red hair?
				Ha! That's a good one dude!
				Kay could be Hook since he's got that feather thing!
				He might try to take that fairy. Heheh
	Chi :
			Ah! A fairy
			> [Where do they come from?]
				Some say all fairies have a fairy godmother
				Others say they come from a magical world far away from here
				But I believe they are always around us - just in hiding
				Which is why I always make sure I do nothing embarrassing...
	Amber :
			Wow! That's so cool!
			> [Wanna buy some fairy dust?]
				Uh...
				Say no to drugs kids
				But thanks anyways - drugs are expensive

OLD HELMET
-----------
	Kay :	
			Uh, hi there
			> [Trade?]
				No I don't need it back
				My new helmet is way better
				My head doesn't ring when I get hit anymore!
			> [Am I a knight now?]
				Ha! Definitely not!
				You have to go through years of training, swear an oath, defeat monsters, protect princesses...
				But at least your head's protected
	Sid :
			Hey, can you see anything out of that thing?
			> [30% of stuff]
				Well that's better than nothing!
				Safety is all that matters!
	Grace :
			Whoa! I haven't seen that helmet in a while!
			> [Since when?]
				I think back when we had all those monsters invade
				They ended up being really nice!
				They were just tourists, but Kay still wanted to fight them...
				He doesn't do well with new people
	Chi : 
			Ah a defensive hat!
			> [... the helmet?]
				Oh... right!
				I mistook it for Kimi's training dummy's accessory
				They look so similar... 
				Or at least serve similar purposes
	Amber : 
			Kay is that you?
			> [...yes?]
				But if you're here... 
				Then who's watching the castle?!

HAT
----
	Kimi :
			Uh huh?
			> [Trade?]
				...
				I like the helmet on my dummy better
				If you don't like the hat just trade with someone else
			> [How do I look?]
				...
				Like a dummy
	Sid :
			Hey nice hat!
			> [Hat club?]
				Dude we could totally start a hat club!
				Only people with the coolest hats in the world can join!
	Grace : 
			Oh man that's a great accessory Kyle!
			> [You think so?]
				Yeah it really brings out your eyes
				But Amber would know best about that kind of fashion stuff
	Chi : 	
			Wow... that hat...
			It looks like it was passed down for generations
			> [It's from Kimi]
				Ah! Of course!
				You must be quite the master to recieve such a gift
				What a high honor!
	Kay :
			Hey don't wear that hat like that!
			> [Like this?]
				(you tilt the hat down slightly)
				Stop! You'll attract a sea bear!

PILLOW
-------
	Amber :
			Hey~
			> [Trade?]
				Buddy I gave you that pillow
				I've got PLENTY more where that came from
				But they're just too comfy to give up!
			> [Pillow fight?]
				Heh... You're talking to the Queen of Pillow Fights
				Are you sure?
				> [Let's fight!]
					(Amber grabs a body-sized pillow and you ready your pillow)
					(her pillow glows blue and she hits you in the face with the force of a truck)
					(you see stars swirling above you)
					I told you! I'm the queen!
				> [I'm too soft]
					That's ok
					My reputation for pillow fights is intimidating I know

	Kimi :
			...fluffy
			> [Wanna sleep on it?]
				I'll pass
				Ninjas don't need sleep
	Sid :
			Whoa that pillow looks comfy!
			> [Like sleeping on a cloud]
				Oh man! Clouds are great 
				I bet Chi sleeps like a rock every night
	Grace :
			That pillow looks sooo soft!
			> [It is!]
				Oh, I'd take such a long nap on that pillow!
				I might never wake up from that
	Kay :
			Who's pillow is that?!
			> [Amber's]
				You stole a pillow from Amber?!
				That's a royal crime!
				I could have you arrested!
				Don't move I need to write a report!

LUCKY DICE
-----------
	Chi:
			Hi there!
			> [Trade?]
				Oh no thanks
				I've got all the luck I need...
				Feel free to give it to someone who is having some bad luck today
			> [How much luck is in it?]
				I'd say it's about 99% luck and 1% hot gas
	Kimi :
			Is that dice?
			> [They're lucky!]
				Yeah right...
				There's no such thing as luck
				Sid would probably believe in gimmicks like that though
	Grace : 
			Aren't you lucky!
			> [Feeling lucky punk?]
				Always! I keep a four leaf clover and horseshoe with me!
	Kay :
			Hey cool dice!
			> [Wanna play a game?]
				Sure why not
				What number do you guess it'll roll on?
				> [7]
					(you roll the dice)
					(4 on one and 3 on the other)
					Aw man! That was lucky!
				> [2]
					(you roll the dice)
					(snake eyes)
					SNAKE?! AAAAGGGHHH!!
				> [13]
					(you roll the dice)
					(6 on one and on the other... a 7?)
					...
					...
					WHAT?!
	Amber :
			Those dice look really fancy
			> [Chi gave them to me]
				Really?
				I bet they're filled with good luck!
				You should always keep those on you!
				Anything could happen!

PLUSH PUPPY
------------
	Sid :
			What's up dude?
			> [Trade?]
				Nooo way man! I don't want it back!
				Those eyes man... 
				The eyes...
			> [Is it cursed?]
				No I don't think so...
				It just stopped being cute and started being more creepy
	Kimi : 
			What is that?
			> [A plush puppy]
				...
				It's cute
				Almost makes me sick
	Chi : 
			Oh what a lovely plush toy
			> [He does tricks]
				Really?
				> [Just kidding]
					Ah...
					That'd be amazing if an inanimate object could perform
				> [Of course!]
					(you throw the plush puppy in the air)
					(it does 4 flips and lands perfectly rightside up on the ground)
					WOW! I've never seen anything like that!
					You have it well trained!
	Kay :
			Agh! A vicious dog!
			> [It's not real]
				?
				Ah! I see...
				False alarm...
				It'd be a decent decoy for a guard dog though
				It could protect Grace's grave from invaders
	Amber :
			*gasp* The puppy is adorbs!
			> [His name's Fanboi]
				Aaawww... I bet he's a big fan of you
				His eyes are just mesmorizing
