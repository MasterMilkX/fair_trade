			> [Hi!]
				"!"
				"God you're chipper..."
				"It's almost annoying actually"
			"I don't think I've seen you around"
			"Who are you?"
			> [Kyle]
				"Huh..."
				"Ok then...Kyle..."
			> [Kyle apparently]
				"Kyle Apparently?"
				"That's quite a name"
				"I'll call you Kyle for short"
			> [Kyle?]
				"You don't know?"
				"... well..."
				"I guess people don't really have a choice on what they get to be called"
			> [I'm Kyle!]
				"Wow..."
				"You seem pretty proud of that"
				"Kyle's an OK name I suppose..."
			"I'm Kimi"
			"How'd you get that token?"
			> [Found it]
				"Lucky you"
				"That token can get you a lot here"
			> [Trade?]
				"Sure... but people don't just give things away around here"
			> [Beats me]
				"Hmm..."
			"I'll trade you something for it"
			"On this world, we get what we need by trading"
			"I need something very important"
			"And I can give you something important in return"
			"If you give me the token, I'll give you something that you can trade with other people"
			"So what do you say?"
			> [Deal]
				"Cool"
				"(you give the token to Kimi)"
				"Take this"
				"(you got a flute from Kimi)"
				"You can't play it - even if you tried"
				"There's another person around that can though - or would at least find some use for it"
				"Go find them, and they'll probably trade you something for it"
				"When you find something that I could use, come back to me"
				"I'll give you something you need"
				"Fair trade"

: You find yourself in a room with samurai swords and watercolor paintings hung on the walls.
: You're sitting on a pillow with a teapot filled with jasmine tea and 2 cups on a table in front of you
: The room smells of flowers and smoke - a violin plays faintly in the distance
: You feel a sense of peace... but incomplete
: Try again?

			> [Can you play this?]
				"..."
				"A long time ago I could..."
				"I don't anymore"
	Chi : 	"Oh, what a lovely flute."
			> [Thanks. Kimi gave it to me]
				"Really?"
				"I never took Kimi for a musician"
				"Sid seems more like the person with an ear for music"
	Kay :	"AGH! What is that?! A weapon?!"
			> [It's a flute]
				"A flute?"
				"Like the music?"
				"I don't trust it."
				"I'd be careful with that thing"
	Grace :	"Wow! A flute!"

				"They played it beautifully!"
	Amber : "?"

S.A. Knife
-----------
	Sid :	"Hiya!"
			> [Trade?]
				"Haha! I gave you that dude"
				"I've fixed up just about everything on my car"
				"Someone else might need it as a tool or weapon though"
			> [What does the S.A. stand for?]
				"Uh..."
				"Sushi Alliance?"
	Kimi : 	"A knife?"
			> [Gimme all your money, punk]
				"..."
				"You know I'm a ninja/samurai, right?"
				"With a much bigger weapon?"
				"The odds are not in your favor, Kyle"
	Chi :	"Hmm... A thing?"
			> [A thingy]
				"Well said, friend"
				"An interesting thingy indeed"
	Grace :	"*gasp* What a cool little doo-dad!"

	Amber : "Erm... What does that do?"
			> [Lots of stuff]
				"Oh..."

				"Or is it lots of stuff that do things?"

Feather
--------
	Kay :	"Agh! A feather! A torture weapon!"

				"Well... I think I gave that to you"
				"And frankly that thing scares me to death"
			> [Torture?]
				"Tickle torture!"
				"It's horrible!"
				"It's like torture!"
				"...wait..."
	Kimi : "A feather?"
			> [Don't make me use this!]
				"..."
				"You're gonna tickle me to death?"
				"Or are you just trying to make me smile?"
				"Either way - it's not gonna work, Kyle"
	Chi :	"Ah, a feather! As light as the soul"
			> [How much do souls weigh?]
				"Hmm..."
				"As much as a feather, I'd wager!"
				"You should ask Grace to be sure"
	Sid :	"That's a big feather!"
			> [It came from a big bird]
				"Must be exotic!"
	Amber :	"That feather looks familiar"
			> [Kay gave it to me]
				"Oh, right."
				"It probably fell out of his helmet and spooked him"

Flower
-------
	Grace : "Do you like the flower?"
			> [Trade?]
				"Psh! You're funny"
				"I gave it to you silly!"
				"You should give it to someone to brighten their day"
			> [I love it]
				"I'm so glad!"
				"I always loved flowers too"
				"They smelled amazing"
	Kimi :	"A flower?"
			> [Pretty?]
				"I suppose..."
				"Smells nice at least"
	Sid :	"Cool flower!"
			> [A million psychadelic colors!]
				"Heh...I might be slightly color-blind"
				"It looks yellow to me"
	Kay :	"Is that a flower?"
			> [Will you marry me?]
				"!"
				"I think you're supposed to propose with a ring..?!"
	Amber : "What an exotic flower"
			> [Exotic?]
				"I don't see them grow often"
				"Just around Grace and Chi once in a blue moon or whatever"

Oil
----
	Chi :	"Lovely fragrance isn't it?"
			> [Trade?]
				"But alas, I am the original owner"
				"And the only fragrance I use is the natural odor of nature"
			> [How'd you make it?]
				"An old trade secret"
	Kimi : 	"Hmm... smells nice"
			> [How nice?]
				"..."
				"Nice?"
	Sid :	"Whoa that smells better than my car!"
			> [Your car?]
				"Yeah... it's smells like pizza and takeout food"
				"I love it!"
	Grace :	"Wow! Did my flower make that?"
			> [Yep]
				"It smells even better than it did as a flower!"
	Kay :	"What's that smell?"
			> [Oil]
				"Amber would probably love that"
				"She always smells so nice when I pass her"

Ribbon
-------
	Amber :	"Hey~"
			> [Trade?]
				"Sweetie I gave you that ribbon"
				"It's probably not your style - but there's gotta be someone who would rock it"
			> [Happy Birthday]
				"?"
				"But it's not my birthday"
				"... Are you the present?"
	Sid : 	"That ribbon looks sleek"
			> [It's really long]
				"Yeah, you could probably jump rope with it!"
	Grace : "What a pretty ribbon!"
			> [I look pretty?]
				"Uh huh!"
				"You look just like Kimi actually!"
	Chi :	"Ah a ribbon!"
			> [What do I do with it?]
				"You could use it to wrap a present"
				"There's no better time like the present"
	Kay :	"Ribbon?!"
			> [What's wrong?]
				"Ribbons are so binding"
				"They can be used as a blindfold!"
				"Then who knows what could happen!"
