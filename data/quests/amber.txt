AMBER TRUE QUEST
+++++++++++++++++

$ Item : Token
---------------
	Amber :
			Oh
			My 
			Gosh!
			Who did your hair? I love it!
			> [I don't know]
				Ooohh ok...
				I see how it is...
				You wanna keep your mysterious hairdresser all to yourself?
				I can respect that 
				I'd probably do the same thing if I had someone who could work magic on my hair
			> [It's natural]
				No way!
				I've never seen anyone just born with that hair color
				Except in cartoons or something
			> [I did]
				Whoa! You did?
				You must be a really good stylist!
				You gotta do mine sometime! Please? Pretty Please?
			Oh! I'm Amber - THE Amber
			> [Kyle]
				Hey Kyle
				What's shakin'?
			> [Name's Kyle]
				Wow, your name's as cool as your hair
			> [It's Kyle?]
				Kyle?
				Do you not know?
				Oh whatever - I like the name Kyle so I'll still call you that
			> [The Kyle]
				Oooh! I've never heard of you
				You must be a rising star! Rad...
			Hey Kyle... What's that?
			> [What?]
				That thing!
				In your pocket!
				That token?
			> [Where?]
				In your pocket...
				Is that a token?
			> [That?]
				Yeah that!
				A token!
			Kyle, my guy, I loooove those things
			I'll trade you something for it
			It's cool I promise
			Cool?
			> [Deal]
				Lit! Thanks Kyle~
				(you give the token to Amber)
				Ok here's my stuff
				(you got a rose from Amber)
				Don't take it personally
				I'm not asking you out or anything LOL
				I just need one more thing - so if you give that to someone they can probably give you another thing
				And then the next person can give you something for that and so on...
				You feel me?
				If you can bring me something cool, I'll give you something I know you'll love
				Sound cool? 
				Fair trade Kyle. Fair trade.
			> [No deal]
				Ugh... Kyyyyllleee
				Don't be laaaaaame...
				Pleeeeasssee?
				> [How could I say no?]
				> [I'm kidding]
				> [Of course!]

$ Item : Rose
--------------
	Grace :
			*gasp* That rose is even prettier than the ones around my grave!
			> [Trade?]
				Yay! Thanks!
				(you give the rose to Grace)
				Oh! Here I have something too!
				(you got a shadow from Grace)
				I don't think it's mine because I can't really make shadows
				But it's gotta belong to someone!
				I hope they find their rightful owner - it seemed really sad
			> [It's special]
				OMG I love it!
				I believe every flower is special 
				But special flowers are SUPER special!

$ Item : Shadow
----------------
	Kimi :
			...
			That shadow doesn't match your body shape
			> [Trade?]
				Hmm... 
				Yeah I guess it fits me better
				(you give the shadow to Kimi)
				This'll help me hide a lot better
				Oh... Um I guess you can have this?
				(you got a bottlecap from Kimi)
				...It had a nice design on it so I kept it
				But some people use it as currency
			> [It's my friend]
				Oh... my apologies
				What's it's name?
				> [Shadow]
					...
					Your shadow's name is Shadow?
					How edgy...
				> [Grey]
					Grey?
					I guess that's a pretty good name for a shadow
				> [Light]
					Light?
					Hmm... I like it...
					It's ironic...

$ Item : Bottlecap
-------------------
	Chi :
			Ah! A bottlecap!
			> [Trade?]
				Oh! You're too generous
				(you give the bottlecap to Chi)
				Here you go - nectar of the gods
				(you got water from Chi)
				Make sure you stay hydrated!
			> [What's so special about it?]
				That's a rare bottlecap
				The soda itself is delicious but it's the bottlecap that holds the real value

$ Item : Water
---------------
	Sid :
			Oh man... my head hurts
			> [Trade?]
				Oh man! You're a life saver!
				(you give the water to Sid)
				Oh hey! This thing fell off of my car
				(you got a chain from Sid)
				I don't know what it goes to but it's probably nothing important
				Looks pretty cool though!
			> [Rough night?]
				Heh... 
				Rough but fun my dude!
				10/10 would do again

$ Item : Chain
---------------
	Kay :
			That's a small chain you have there
			> [Trade?]
				Hmm... I have had this thing I've wanted to do but I've been too shy to try
				(you give the chain to Kay)
				Ok... give me a second
				(Kay turns around, hunched over, making grunting noises)
				Ok I'm done!
				(Kay turns back to face you - his hands are rough and he's out of breath)
				Ta-da
				(you got an amulet from Kay)
				Well what do you think?
				I've been trying my hand at jewreley making
				...
				What did you think I was doing with the chain?
			> [For small hands]
				Ah yes!
				Those fiends could slip right out of normal chains!
				Smart thinking!

$ Item : Amulet
----------------
	Amber :
			That amulet...
			It's gorgeous!
			> [Trade?]
				Yes please!
				(you give the amulet to Amber)
				Oh it looks amazing on me!
				I'm going to wear it everyday for the rest of my life
				Thanks, Kyle!
				You're the best
				Oh! Here's that cool thing I promised you
				(you got a special key from Amber)
				I hope you have a great time!
				I'll see you around!
			> [Kay made it]
				Kay made that?
				I didn't know he was so talented!
				I'll have to give him a promotion!

End Game
---------
			(you find yourself in a large throne room with banners hanging from the ceiling and stained-glass windows flooding light into the room)
			(you're sitting on the throne in colorfully expensive clothes - an empty, shiny suit of armor stands next to you)
			(outside you hear festival music and people laughing and singing - a long table covered in meats, drink, and desserts before you)
			(you feel a sense of peace - but incomplete)
			(try again?)



HINTS/SIDE CONVO
+++++++++++++++++

ROSE
-----
	Amber :
			Hey Kyle~
			> [Trade]
				Kyyllleee...
				I already picked it! I don't want it back
				And it hurt a lot.
				You should give it to someone you like instead
			> [Is it really a rose?]
				Of course!
				"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet"
				...Could just be a red flower though
	Kimi :
			A rose?
			> [Fills my dreams]
			What dreams?
			No one even sleeps around here
	Sid :
			Man that is a pretty flower!
			> [Sharp too]
				Really?
				I guess it keeps people from picking it
				Otherwise EVERYONE would have roses and it probably wouldn't be as treasured
	Chi :
			What an intricate pattern!
			> [On the rose?]
				Yes!
				It weaves in and out of it's own petals
				It's even more intricate than Grace's roses
	Kay :
			A princess rose!
			> [A what?]
				Princess roses are magical
				They usually have enchanted spells on it
				Be careful with the petals!
				You might accidentally curse someone!

SHADOW
-------
	Grace :
			Hi!
			> [Trade?]
				Oh, no that's ok
				I just want that shadow to find a nice home
				A grave can get kinda spooky with a shadow around it all the time
				No offense to the shadow!
			> [Which way does it face?]
				Oh... hmmm...
				North?
				Sometimes south?
				I think it depends on it's mood

	Sid :
			Whoa! Is that a shadow?
			> [It's not mine]
				It's not yours?
				I've never seen someone with another person's shadow
				That must be some CRAZY magic trick!
	Chi :
			How ominous
			> [How?]
				Shadows are the darkness to our light selves
				Then again - neither can live without the other
				So they also represent harmony and balance
	Kay :
			AGH! What is that beast?!
			> [A shadow?]
				How do you hit it?!
				It isn't affected by anything physical!
				It's invincible!
				Run for your life!
	Amber :
			Oooo spooky shadow!
			> [It's my Hallo -ween costume]
				That's a snazzy costume!
				Seems hard to put on and take off though

BOTTLECAP
----------
	Kimi :
			> [Trade?]
				...No?
				I gave that one to you
				I know it's junk - just convince someone else to trade with you
			> [Why do you have this?]
				...
				I just think they're neat...
	Sid :
			Hey is that a bottlecap?
			> [Yep!]
				Coooool! 
				What soda was it from?
				> [Cola]
					Classic!
					They're great for sharing 
					Or bets to chug them in less than a minute - heh heh
				> [Root beer]
					Ah, that's my favorite!
					I could drink that stuff by the keg!
				> [Ginger beer]
					Whoa!
					You're pretty intense dude!
					Those things always burn the back of my throat
				> [Orange soda]
					Aw man those are the best!
					The perfect amount of orange and fizz
	Grace :
			Hey I've seen those before!
			> [On bottles?]
				Yeah!
				They're better than can sodas because it's like you get a little souvenir when you're done
	Kay :
			What kind of medal is that?
			> [The Ellie badge]
				...
				Who's Ellie?
	Amber :
			Are you starting a collection of those?
			> [Why?]
				Chi's into collecting those things
				He thinks the apocolypse is coming and that bottlecaps will become the new currency
				...Or he just really likes the design

WATER
------
	Chi : 
			Why hello
			> [Trade?]
				Ah, that's quite alright
				I am extremely hydrated at the moment
				Actually...
				I might be a little too hydrated...
			> [Where did you get this]
				Every few years it rains on this world
				On those few chances I collect the rain water and purify it
				I keep gallons stored in my secret stash
	Kimi :
			... Is that water?
			> [Yep!]
				Water sucks
				Gatorade is better
				...But stay hydrated
				Sid tends to forget that often

	Grace :
			Ah! Water!
			> [So pure]
				Oh man that must be spring water from a secret mountain or something
				It'll probably cleanse your whole soul!
	Kay :
			Water?! 
			> [What's wrong?]
				That'll rust my armor!
				It'll be almost useless after that!
				That's why I hate the rain
	Amber :
			Ugh waaater!
			> [Is that good?]
				Yes! Water is great!
				You should drink about 2 liters a day
				Or a whole lake if you can!

CHAIN
------
	Sid : 
			Hey bro!
			> [Trade?]
				No thanks!
				That chain just gives me anxiety just looking at it
				There's DEFINITELY something missing from my car...
				So better to just ignore it!
			> [Why is it so small?]
				I can't tell if it came from my car...
				Or old jewreley...
				Or maybe a tiny car!
	Kimi :
			...A chain?
			> [Fun huh?]
				?!
				(Kimi looks away startled and confused)
	Grace :
			Oooo chains!
			> [Oooo?]
				I was making spooky ghosts noises like with rattling chains!
				OoooOOOoooO!
				Ha ha!
	Chi :
			Ah! Break free of those chains!
			> [...I am free]
				Oh!
				I thought Kay took you prisoner...
				But congrats on being a free man!
	Amber :
			Why do you have chains?
			> [I'm in a gang]
				Whoa!
				Do you know any signs?
				> [Heck ye]
					(you attempt to form a series of complex gestures with your hands)
					(3 clones of yourself spontaneously appear beside you)
					...
					You're in a ninja gang?!
				> [Nah]
					Heh...
					Kyle you're such a poser
					It's still cool though~

AMULET
-------
	Kay :
			Oh hi
			> [Trade?]
				Oh no, I don't wear things I make
				Besides it doesn't match my eyes
			> [How'd you make this?]
				Um...
				A secret trick a wise man taught me
				I think he was also a wizard and a baker on the side
	Kimi :
			...Hmm..
			Pretty...
			> [Does it match my eyes?]
				Definitely not
				Glowing white is hard to match
	Sid :
			Hey that's a really fancy amulet!
			> [Kay made it]
				Kay can make jewreley?
				Man, he's a guy of many talents
				If Amber knew that, she'd be all over him
				He'd have to quit his job as a knight and become an artisan for her
	Grace :
			*gasp* That's so pretty!
			> [Pretty?]
				Yeah it's gorgeous!
				I bet everywhere you go people fall in love with you when you have that on!
	Chi :
			That amulet! It's so enchanting!
			> [Is it magic?]
				It could be!
				Amulets that red and bright usually hold some sort of mystical power
				It could be a horcrux! Or hold a soul!
				...Or just be a really nice fashion statement
