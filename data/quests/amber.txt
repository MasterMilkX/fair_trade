AMBER TRUE QUEST
+++++++++++++++++

$ Item : Token
---------------
	Amber :
			Oh
			My 
			Gosh!
			Who did your hair? I love it!
			> [I don't know]
				Ooohh ok...
				I see how it is...
				You wanna keep your mysterious hairdresser all to yourself?
				I can respect that 
				I'd probably do the same thing if I had someone who could work magic on my hair
			> [It's natural]
				No way!
				I've never seen anyone just born with that hair color
				Except in cartoons or something
			> [I did]
				Whoa! You did?
				You must be a really good stylist!
				You gotta do mine sometime! Please? Pretty Please?
			Oh! I'm Amber - THE Amber
			> [Kyle]
				Hey Kyle
				What's shakin'?
			> [Name's Kyle]
				Wow, your name's as cool as your hair
			> [It's Kyle?]
				Kyle?
				Do you not know?
				Oh whatever - I like the name Kyle so I'll still call you that
			> [The Kyle]
				Oooh! I've never heard of you
				You must be a rising star! Rad...
			Hey Kyle... What's that?
			> [What?]
				That thing!
				In your pocket!
				That token?
			> [Where?]
				In your pocket...
				Is that a token?
			> [That?]
				Yeah that!
				A token!
			Kyle, my guy, I loooove those things
			I'll trade you something for it
			It's cool I promise
			Cool?
			> [Deal]
				Lit! Thanks Kyle~
				(you give the token to Amber)
				Ok here's my stuff
				(you got a rose from Amber)
				Don't take it personally
				I'm not asking you out or anything LOL
				I just need one more thing - so if you give that to someone they can probably give you another thing
				And then the next person can give you something for that and so on...
				You feel me?
				If you can bring me something cool, I'll give you something I know you'll love
				Sound cool? 
				Fair trade Kyle. Fair trade.
			> [No deal]
				Ugh... Kyyyyllleee
				Don't be laaaaaame...
				Pleeeeasssee?
				> [How could I say no?]
				> [I'm kidding]
				> [Of course!]

$ Item : Rose
--------------
	Grace :
			*gasp* That rose is even prettier than the ones around my grave!
			> [Trade?]
				Yay! Thanks!
				(you give the rose to Grace)
				Oh! Here I have something too!
				(you got a shadow from Grace)
				I don't think it's mine because I can't really make shadows
				But it's gotta belong to someone!
				I hope they find their rightful owner - it seemed really sad
			> [It's special]
				OMG I love it!
				I believe every flower is special 
				But special flowers are SUPER special!

$ Item : Shadow
----------------
	Kimi :
			...
			That shadow doesn't match your body shape
			> [Trade?]
				Hmm... 
				Yeah I guess it fits me better
				(you give the shadow to Kimi)
				This'll help me hide a lot better
				Oh... Um I guess you can have this?
				(you got a bottlecap from Kimi)
				...It had a nice design on it so I kept it
				But some people use it as currency
			> [It's my friend]
				Oh... my apologies
				What's it's name?
				> [Shadow]
					...
					Your shadow's name is Shadow?
					How edgy...
				> [Grey]
					Grey?
					I guess that's a pretty good name for a shadow
				> [Light]
					Light?
					Hmm... I like it...
					It's ironic...

$ Item : Bottlecap
-------------------
	Chi :
			Ah! A bottlecap!
			> [Trade?]
				Oh! You're too generous
				(you give the bottlecap to Chi)
				Here you go - nectar of the gods
				(you got water from Chi)
				Make sure you stay hydrated!
			> [What's so special about it?]
				That's a rare bottlecap
				The soda itself is delicious but it's the bottlecap that holds the real value

$ Item : Water
---------------
	Sid :
			Oh man... my head hurts
			> [Trade?]
				Oh man! You're a life saver!
				(you give the water to Sid)
				Oh hey! This thing fell off of my car
				(you got a chain from Sid)
				I don't know what it goes to but it's probably nothing important
				Looks pretty cool though!
			> [Rough night?]
				Heh... 
				Rough but fun my dude!
				10/10 would do again

$ Item : Chain
---------------
	Kay :
			That's a small chain you have there
			> [Trade?]
				Hmm... I have had this thing I've wanted to do but I've been too shy to try
				(you give the chain to Kay)
				Ok... give me a second
				(Kay turns around, hunched over, making grunting noises)
				Ok I'm done!
				(Kay turns back to face you - his hands are rough and he's out of breath)
				Ta-da
				(you got an amulet from Kay)
				Well what do you think?
				I've been trying my hand at jewreley making
				...
				What did you think I was doing with the chain?
			> [For small hands]
				Ah yes!
				Those fiends could slip right out of normal chains!
				Smart thinking!

$ Item : Amulet
----------------
	Amber :
			That amulet...
			It's gorgeous!
			> [Trade?]
				Yes please!
				(you give the amulet to Amber)
				Oh it looks amazing on me!
				I'm going to wear it everyday for the rest of my life
				Thanks, Kyle!
				You're the best
				Oh! Here's that cool thing I promised you
				(you got a special key from Amber)
				I hope you have a great time!
				I'll see you around!
			> [Kay made it]
				Kay made that?
				I didn't know he was so talented!
				I'll have to give him a promotion!

End Game
---------
			(you find yourself in a large throne room with banners hanging from the ceiling and stained-glass windows flooding light into the room)
			(you're sitting on the throne in colorfully expensive clothes - an empty, shiny suit of armor stands next to you)
			(outside you hear festival music and people laughing and singing - a long table covered in meats, drink, and desserts before you)
			(you feel a sense of peace - but incomplete)
			(try again?)
