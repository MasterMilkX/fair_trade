CORRUPT QUEST
++++++++++++++

? If you trade with someone who doesn't match the item - these dialogs trigger
? They can be traded back unless they are traded with someone who matches the item
? The quest then switches over to that item quest - but triggers a corrupt end game

				"...fine"
Sid [Trade?] :	"Um...."

				"I suppose it is meant to be"
Grace [Trade?] : "Oh..."
				 "If you want"
Kay [Trade?] :	"What?"
				"Oh right..."
Amber [Trade?] : "*sigh*"
				 "Okaaay..."

Sid [Trade Back?] 	: "Heck yes!"
Chi [Trade Back?] 	: "Aaah"
Grace [Trade Back?]	: "Yay!"
Kay [Trade Back?]	: "Of course!"
Amber [Trade Back?] : "Absolutely!"
